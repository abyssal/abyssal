### Kiā ora, and hello 👋   
I'm a full-stack software engineer and developer from **New Zealand**.

👾 On the backend, I prefer to work with **C#** and **ASP.NET**, but I'm experienced with **Java, Kotlin, and Python** backend stacks.
  
🖌 For the frontend, my best skills are in **React**, but I'm familiar with **Vue and Svelte**.

🌏 I run systems administration for my websites, projects, and home server, using **Nginx** with a **Cloudflare** front.
  
☁️ I have experience with **AWS** and **Azure**, managing load balancers, virtual networks, and virtual machines.
